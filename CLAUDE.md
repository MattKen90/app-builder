# Claude Code App Builder

A lightweight, Claude Code-first framework for building complete applications and products.

## Purpose

This repo provides a minimal yet powerful foundation for delivering full applications using Claude Code as the primary development engine. No API calls, no additional costs—just your Claude Code subscription.

## Philosophy

- **Claude Code First**: Built entirely around Claude Code primitives and capabilities
- **Zero External Costs**: No API keys, no pay-per-use services—subscription only
- **Lean by Design**: Strip away everything unnecessary; keep only what delivers value
- **Full Product Delivery**: Lightweight doesn't mean limited—ship complete, production-ready apps

## Core Primitives

This project leverages Claude Code's native capabilities:

- **Slash Command Skills** (`/commands`) - Custom workflows and automations
- **MCP Servers** - Extended tooling and integrations
- **Plugins** - Modular functionality extensions
- **Subagents** - Specialized task delegation via the Task tool

## Getting Started

This repo is designed to be used directly with Claude Code. Open the project and start building—Claude Code has full context from this file.

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity over complexity** - If it can be simpler, make it simpler
2. **Native over external** - Prefer Claude Code primitives over third-party solutions
3. **Pragmatic minimalism** - Include what's needed, nothing more
4. **Rapid iteration** - Fast feedback loops, quick deployments
