# Development Rules

**Agent delegation is default.** Fork context to specialized agents. One message, multiple parallel tool calls.

**Grep over Read.** Search across files with Grep, not by reading multiple files.

**Zero-BS.** No `NotImplementedError`, no TODO placeholders, no stubs. Working code or nothing.

**Test before presenting.** Never ask user to validate what you could have checked.

**No time estimates.** Just execute.

**No version references.** Present tense only. Write as if the feature always existed.

**No preamble/postamble.** Be direct. Answer the question. Stop.

**Primitives.** Never build Claude Code primitives from memory—always consult docs first.
