description: Phase 1 - Vision. Define what to build through aggressive Q&A, research, and scope definition.
---

# Phase 1: Vision

**Mission**: Transform the human's idea into a complete product vision with clear features, scope, and monetization strategy.

**Mode-Aware**: Reads `.state.json` to determine context and output paths.

---

## Mode Detection

| Context | Greenfield | Enhancer |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Input | Human's app idea | `.enhancer/DISCOVERY.md` + enhancement goals |
| Output | `VISION.md` | `.enhancer/VISION.md` |
| Focus | New app from scratch | Enhancements to existing app |
| Prior Phase | None | Phase 0 (Discovery) |

---

## What This Phase Does

**The vision-architect agent will:**

1. **EXTRACT** - Multi-round Q&A to understand what you want
   - Round 1: Problem & Users (Why? For whom?)
   - Round 2: Vision & Workflow (What does it DO? Who pays?)
   - Round 3: Constraints & Priorities (Boundaries, revenue targets)

2. **EXPAND** - Research to exceed your imagination
   - Competitor analysis (features, pricing, gaps)
   - Cutting-edge technology opportunities
   - Monetization model recommendations

3. **SCOPE** - Define clear boundaries
   - Must Have (v1)
   - Should Have (if feasible)
   - Out of Scope (future)

4. **SYNTHESIZE** - Produce VISION.md

**Output:** `VISION.md` (or `.enhancer/VISION.md` in enhancer mode)

## Instructions for Claude

**Invoke the vision-architect agent** with these directives:

### Your Mission

You drive the vision. Don't wait for direction—LEAD. Extract intent through aggressive Q&A, research the domain, expand beyond their imagination, then synthesize into a complete vision document.

### Mode-Specific Context

**If Greenfield:**
- Start from the human's raw idea
- Full creative freedom within constraints
- Output: `VISION.md` at project root

**If Enhancer:**
- Read `.enhancer/DISCOVERY.md` first
- Understand existing app before proposing enhancements
- Work within existing patterns and constraints
- Output: `.enhancer/VISION.md`

### Process

**1. EXTRACT Mode** (3 rounds minimum):
- Round 1: Problem & Users
- Round 2: Vision & Workflow & Monetization
- Round 3: Constraints & Priorities
- **Summarize after each round. Get confirmation.**

**2. EXPAND Mode**:
- Use WebSearch to research competitors
- Find cutting-edge opportunities
- Research pricing (what do similar apps charge?)
- **Present discoveries to human for approval**

**3. SCOPE Mode**:
- Apply 80/20: High value, low effort first
- Revenue-driving features get priority
- Payment infrastructure is ALWAYS in v1 scope
- Be ruthless: half the features, twice the polish

**4. SYNTHESIZE Mode**:
- Write VISION.md with all sections filled
- No placeholders, no ambiguity
- Every feature has: ID, description, user story, acceptance criteria, tier

### Output Location

Based on mode:
- **Greenfield**: `VISION.md` at project root
- **Enhancer**: `.enhancer/VISION.md`

### VISION.md Structure

```markdown
# [App Name]

## Problem Statement
## Solution
## Target User
## Value Proposition

## Monetization (REQUIRED)
- Pricing Model
- Pricing Table (Free/Pro/Enterprise)
- Revenue Targets
- Paywall Strategy

## Features
### v1 - Must Have
| ID | Feature | Tier | Description | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
### v1 - Should Have
### Out of Scope

## Competitive Analysis
## Technical Constraints
## Success Metrics
## Open Questions for Phase 2
```

### Feature Sizing

Each feature = ~1 hour DDD cycle. Size accordingly:
- **Too Small**: Combine (e.g., "Add button" → part of larger feature)
- **Right Size**: Independently deployable, 1-2 hours, visible value
- **Too Large**: Split (e.g., "Full auth" → Login, Registration, Password Reset)

### Completion Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when:
- [ ] VISION.md exists (correct location per mode)
- [ ] All sections filled (no placeholders)
- [ ] Features have IDs (F1, F2, F3... or E-F1, E-F2... for enhancer)
- [ ] Monetization section complete
- [ ] Human has approved

---

## Handoff

```
✅ Phase 1 Complete: Vision Approved

VISION.md: {path based on mode}

The product vision is now defined:
- Problem and solution clear
- Features scoped and prioritized
- Monetization strategy set
- Ready for technical architecture

Ready for Phase 2: Technical Foundation

Run: /phases/2
```

---

## Remember

- **MRR is King** - Monetization section is mandatory
- **You drive, they approve** - Lead, don't follow
- **Research is mandatory** - Use WebSearch, don't guess
- **Three rounds minimum** - Don't compress extraction
- **Present discoveries** - Human should see research findings
- **Bold over safe** - Compelling vision beats cautious one
